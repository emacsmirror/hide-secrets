* Hide secrets mode

Hide secrets mode is a minor mode for GNU Emacs to hide all kind of secrets in Emacs buffers,
using overlays.

[[file:hide-secrets.gif]]

At the moments it tries to hide:

 - user names
 - email addresses
 - passwords
 - IP addresses (both v4 and v6)
 - hash sums
 - public ssh keys

Please feel free to ask for additional secrets.

** Customize

You can also add your own secrets by customizing =hide-secrets-alist=.

The face that is used to highlight where secrets are replaced by display string to hide them is also customizable with the =hide-secrets-face= variable.

** Installation

You can either download hide-secrets.el from gitlab and add

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'hide-secrets)
#+END_SRC

to your Emacs init file; or you can install the package with use-package using quelpa like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package hide-secrets
    :quelpa (hide-secrets
	     :fetcher git
	     :url "https://gitlab.com/ostseepinguin1/hide-secrets-el.git")
    :ensure t
    :bind (("C-c s" . hide-secrets)
	   ("C-c S" . hide-secrets-show))
    :autoload hide-secrets-mode)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: hide-secrets-show

This would bind ~C-s s~ to =hide-secrets= and ~C-s S~ to hide-secrets-show.

** Usage

You can hide secrets by invoking =hide-secrets= and show them with =hide-secrets-show=.

You can also activate the minor mode =hide-secrets-mode= that hides secrets as you type them.

** Reveal mode support

If you use =hide-secrets-mode= you can additionally activate =reveal-mode= so secrets at point
are reveal - shown in plain text.

** TODO

The package is still in early development. Next on my agenda is integration with all terminal emulators, like (ansi-)term an vterm, which turn out, to be much more difficult then eshell and eat. Don't know yet, if I can realize this. Help would be appreciated.
